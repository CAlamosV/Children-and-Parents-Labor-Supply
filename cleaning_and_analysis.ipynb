    "## Estimating The Effect of Having Children on Labor Supply using a Sibling-Sex Composition Instrument\n",
    "\n",
    "I follow [Angrist and Evans (1998)](http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/fichiers/enseig/ecoineg/articl/AngristEvans1998.pdf) and use 1980 census data to estimate the effect of having children on labor supply.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, I exploit the fact that if the first two children in a family are of the same sex, the probability of having a third child is higher.\n",
    "I use this exogenous variation in number of children to estimate the effect of having a third child on labor supply through an Instrumental Variables (IV) approach.\n",
    "I estimate my results separately for all women, married women, and husbands.\n",
    "\n",
    "The empirical specification is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "First Stage:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{ThreeOrMoreChildren}_i = \\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 \\cdot \\text{SameSex}_i + \\mathbf{X}_i' \\beta + u_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Second Stage:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Y}_i = \\gamma_0 + \\gamma_1 \\cdot \\hat{\\text{ThreeOrMoreChildren}}_i + \\mathbf{X}_i' \\delta + \\epsilon_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $\\text{ThreeOrMoreChildren}_i$ is a binary variable indicating whether family $i$ has three or more children.\n",
    "- $\\text{Y}_i$ is the outcome for a parent in family $i$. This can be an indicator for labor force participation, hours worked per week, weeks worked per year, or annual labor income.\n",
    "- $\\hat{\\text{ThreeOrMoreChildren}}_i$ is the predicted value from the first stage.\n",
    "- $\\text{SameSex}_i$ is the instrument for having three or more children.\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{X}_i$ is a vector of control variables including the mother's age, race, and age at birth of oldest child, as well as indicators for the gender of children.\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficient of interest is $\\gamma_1$, which captures the causal effect of having three or more children on labor supply.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used is available for public use and can be downloaded at this [link](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=hdl:1902.1/11288) from the Harvard Dataverse (the filename is `m_d_806.tab`)."

    "   \n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Quarter Adjustments**: Adjust quarter variables (`mom_quarter_married`, `mom_quarter_birth`, `quarter_birth_oldest_child`) by subtracting 1 to correct for 1-indexing.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Computed Variables**:\n",
    "   - **Marriage Timing**: Calculate the year and quarter of marriage based on the mother’s birth year and age at marriage.\n",
    "   - **Age at First Birth**: Compute the mother’s and father’s ages at the birth of their first child using the quarter age of the oldest child.\n",
    "   - **Unmarried Birth Indicator**: Create a binary variable indicating if the birth of the first child occurs before marriage.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Race/Ethnicity Indicators**: Create binary indicators for race/ethnicity categories, with `mom_other_race` defined as neither Black, Hispanic, nor White.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Father's Birth Year**: Compute the father's birth year based on his age and adjust for the quarter of birth.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Child Gender Indicators**: Create binary variables to indicate the sex of the first and second born, as well as whether both children are the same sex.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Labor Force Participation**: Create binary indicators for whether the mother or father works based on weeks worked.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **CPI Adjustment**: Adjust the income variables to 1995 dollars using a CPI factor of 1.85.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Constant Term**: Add a constant column to the dataset for regression purposes.\n"
